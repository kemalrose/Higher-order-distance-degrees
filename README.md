# Code for *Osculating Geometry and Higher-Order Distance Loci*

This repository contains the code used in the paper  
**"Osculating Geometry and Higher-Order Distance Loci"**  
by Sandra Di Rocco, Kemal Rose, and Luca Sodomaco.

## Contents

The following `.m2` scripts are included:

- **`illustrative_example.m2`**  
  Computes the data loci displayed in *Figure 2* (see the *Illustrative Example* in the introduction of the paper).

- **`example_5_10.m2`**  
  Computes the data loci displayed in *Figure 5* (see *Example 5.10*).

- **`chern_classes_symmetric_power.m2`**  
  Computes the Chern classes of the symmetric power of a vector bundle.  
  This is used in *Lemma 6.1*.

- **`gDD_k-regular_embedding.m2`**  
  Utilizes the recursive formula in *Equation (6.3)* to compute the Chern classes of the jet bundles of a \(k\)-regular embedding.  
  This allows computation of the \(k\)th-order polar degrees and the \(k\)th-order distance degree of a given \(k\)-regular embedding.  
  As an example, the formulas are applied to \(k\)-regular Segreâ€“Veronese embeddings.
